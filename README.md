# Pokémon Meal Planner

*An interactive web app that turns meal planning into an adventure.*

---

## ✦ Overview

**Pokémon Menu Planner** is a web application that combines practical meal tracking with the 
familiar fun of Pokémon. Designed primarily for children and families, it transforms healthy eating 
into a shared experience between the user and their chosen Pokémon companion.

This project was developed as a final for **CS366: Software Languages and Tools**, where I chose the
"meal planner" track and tailored it toward younger users. The goal: make nutrition more engaging
through interactivity, character design, and playful logic.

## ✦ What You Can Do

- **Choose your Pokémon companion**  
  Select from a themed list of characters to begin your journey. Only a select few Pokémon are available
  at this time for the prototype.	

- **Personalize its profile**  
  Enter nickname, weight, allergies — the app responds dynamically. With more time, I would have added some
  minigames and animations to make this more engaging.

- **Get health feedback**  
  The system evaluates your Pokémon's status and recommends food based on weight and type. The Pokémon's image
  changes to reflect its health. 

- **Avoid unsafe foods**  
  Each Pokémon has food restrictions based on canonical traits (e.g., fire-types avoiding spicy foods).

- **Plan meals**  
  Use a form-based UI to plan Pokémon meals by day and mealtime (breakfast, lunch, dinner). With more time,
  I would have added capabilities for several users to collaborate on the weekly meal planner side of this
  project and a random meal generator.
